# Python_Instacart_Analysis

Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. The company has good sales, but wants to uncover insights about consumer behavior. Exploratory analysis is used to discover sales patterns and offer strategies for better segmentation.

The analysis is focused on spending related to times of day and the week of most purchasing and characteristics of consumers that might indicate different purchasing behavior.

Data used for this analysis was provided by the course provider -- CareerFoundry. The following Python tools were used in the analysis:

* Jupyter Notebook: for writing and executing Python code
* Pandas: for data analization
* Seaborn: for data visualization
* Matplotlib: for data visualization
* Numpy: for mathematical equations
* SciPy: for mathematical equations

The project folders include the project brief (more detailed information on the project background), python scripts, analysis (visualizations), and the client deliverable (Excel report).
